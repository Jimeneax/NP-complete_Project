# Approximation Solution README

## Introduction
This folder contains the Python code for our approximation solution to the given
problem. The solution is designed to provide reasonable approximations efficiently
in polynomial time.

## File Structure
- `approximation_solution.py`: The main Python script containing the approximation
-  solution.
- `run_examples.sh`: Shell script to run the program on various test cases.
- `approximation_notes.pdf`: Document providing additional notes on the approximation
-  solution.
- `README.txt`: This file providing instructions and commands.

## Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it
    from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository/approx_solution

3. **Run the Approximation Solution:**
    `Execute the run_examples.sh script to run the program on various test cases, including
     one where the approximation solution does not achieve the optimal answer.

bash
./run_examples.sh
